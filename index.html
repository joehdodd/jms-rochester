        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          The Parkman Restaurant Group is opening Jersey Mike's Subs locations
          in the Rochester Market. We are excited to establish and develop the
          brand in the area. Like the original Mike's store in 1956, each Jersey
          Mike's Subs serves submarine sandwiches made to order, slicing the
          meats and cheeses on fresh bread, baked in store. At Jersey Mike’s, we
          offer a sub above – one that’s measured in more than inches or seconds
          ‘til served.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We carefully consider every aspect of what we do – every slice, every
          sandwich, every store – we provide our customers with sustenance and
          substance too. We believe that making a great sub sandwich and making
          a difference can be one in the same. Because the way we see it, a
          sub’s job isn’t done at simply tasting good. A sub should do good too.
          We hope you join us in this wave of growth as Jersey Mike's has 1,800
          stores and growing!
